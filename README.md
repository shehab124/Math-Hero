2. The user selects the wanted button by pressing on it using the left button of the
mouse.
3. If the PLAY button is selected from the menu the Math Hero game starts;
a. The game is a stream of simple random equations (addition, subtraction,
and multiplications), that moves from the bottom of the game window to
the top (like the cast of the movies), the user tries to solve as many as he
can in 60 seconds. The top left corner of the window shows the current
score of the user. The figure below shows an example of the game play.

b. The user inserts an answer by writing a number on the keyboard then
pressing the enter button, if the answer is right; the score is incremented
by one, if it is wrong nothing happens.
c. After 60 seconds of the random equations stream, the game
automatically stops, and a window appears that inform the user with its
final score and rank, as seen in figure 3.
